# Ansible Collection

A collection of [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) playbooks I use(d) at work.

Usually in my daily job, I find myself in the need of running locally external 
applications or services for my development environment, such search engines,
specific databases and other stuff. You know what I am talking about :)

In order to have those services running without messing too much with my local
system, I use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) a lot, like most of you.
Using Ansible to automate Vagrant machines set up and share the configuration
with my work mates is my mainly choice, so I will try to collect here most of
the playbooks I wrote or I will write, standarising them to be ran in an
[Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](https://github.com/jose-lpa/packer-ubuntu_14.04/releases/download/1.0/ubuntu-14.04.box) 
system.
